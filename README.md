# Extended Essay Code
Code I developed for my IB Extended Essay in Computer Science.

The `Algorithms/` directory contains the main code for formulating Sudoku problems as constraint satisfaction problems, the Maintaining Arc Consistency algorithm, and the Forward Checking algorithm.

The `SudokuBoardGenerator/` directory contains the code used to generate Sudoku problems of orders 2-5 (4x4-25x25 grids) and was adapted from [this StackExchange post](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/141763/generating-large-sudoku-grid-in-c).
